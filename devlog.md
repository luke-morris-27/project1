## For this project I am creating a prefix notation expression calculator, which takes user input and stores previous outputs to be reused. I plan on doing some research on such programs in other languages, and learning the paradigms
## of Haskell better so I can translate it to Haskell. I may write some pseudocode to figure out the functions that will be necessary.
